# Computer-Game-Architecture-and-Implementation
Code for all assignments in the CSc 165 course - Computer Game Architecture and Implementation

The purpose of this class was to learn the fundamentals of programming and implementing a game using object-oriented programming techniques.
Topics include:
 - Input Handling, Controllers, Event Processing, HUDs
 - 3D Coordinates, Models, Transforms, Projections, Lighting
 - Camera Controls, 1P v. 3P, Chase/Orbit, Viewports
 - Display Modes, FSEM, Rendering
 - Scenegraphs, Scripting
 - Networked Multiplayer, Protocols
 - Game World (textures, skyboxes, visibility)
 - Terrain algorithms and tools, Modeling
 - Modeling tools, Animation, Keyframes and Skeletal Systems
 - Physics Engines, Collisions
 - NPCs, AI
 - 3D Sound, OpenAL and JOAL
 - Particle systems
 
 Programming was done in the ECS department's proprietary engine, RAGE (Ray's Awesome Game Engine), which used JOGL (Java OpenGL) as a replacement for OpenGL, which would be used in a C++ language.
